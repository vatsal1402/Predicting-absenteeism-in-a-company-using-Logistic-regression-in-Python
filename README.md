# Predicting-absenteeism-in-a-company-using-Logistic-regression-in-Python
### This Case study was done as a part of a course project where I used Logistic regression to predict the likelihhod of an employe to remain absent for a particular day taking into account multiple reasons like 
* #### Distance to Work
* #### Transportation Expense
* #### Daily work load average
* #### Age
* #### Number of Children
* #### Any pets
